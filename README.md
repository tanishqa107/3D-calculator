## Web-Based Interactive Calculator

This project is a web-based calculator designed to resemble an actual physical calculator. It features a sleek rectangular design positioned in the center of the screen, with a 3D appearance similar to a mobile phone. The top section functions as a display, and the buttons are arranged below it for easy interaction. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and displays the entire equation on the screen as calculations are performed.
